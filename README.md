# Max and Summation of Array

* HW 5
* CPTS 260
* MIPS

> In this program, you should define an array of 10 elements in your data segment with these values: 𝐴={11,12,−10,13,9,12,14,15,−20}

> a. Write a function which finds the maximum value of this array.

> b. Write another function which calculates the summation of this array.

> c. Call these functions in your main program, and print the outputs of these functions to the user

> > i. “The maximum is 15”

> > ii. “The summation is 56”
